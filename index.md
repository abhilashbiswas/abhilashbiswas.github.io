# About Me

I am Abhilash and I am currently pursuing an MS in public policy and data science at Carnegie Mellon University. I have a background in Economics. Prior to this, I worked for four years at [IDinsight][1], a global non profit, where we generated data-driven evidence to help policymakers make informed decisions. 

I am keen to use data and analytics to tackle complex problems, especially those that can positively impact lives. During my prior work experience, I spent time tackling the [complex problems][2] that policymakers in India face while attempting to deliver critical welfare services to the masses. I was a founding member of lean innovation team called [Data on Demand][3] that used technological innovation to make high quality data accessible to policymakers. 

At CMU, I have focused my time towards obtaining rigorous computer science skills and supplementing my policy experience. I have worked in understanding the math behind data structures and algorithms, building and deploying end to end machine learning pipelines, as well as understanding how to work with policymakers to convert evidence into action. 

If you have an interesting problem that requires a quantitative approach using data and analytics, I would love to discuss more about it. You can find my portfolio of selected projects, resume and my email on this website.
